          <p>The scholarly communication ecosystem communicates the prevailing modes of thought, knowledge creation, and knowledge sharing of the time. Building a scholarly communication project or program that is truly inclusive of existing voices, thoughts, and perspectives takes time, critical reflection, and iterative thinking. 
This intersectional feminist team—that includes six women who stand at the forefront of the scholarly communication work in their respective regions, institutions, and fields—comes together to explore what it means to build a truly inclusive, feminist-centered scholarly communication agenda, rooted in a foundation of equity. </p>
<p>We explore how feminist principles embodies in our Femifesto, a multilingual (Spanish, English, and Portuguese, as of this writing) feminist-centered framework for collaborative scholarly communication, can be used to explore scenarios and use cases that arise in a variety of international as well as local scholarly communication contexts. We explore how to  enact an ethic of care to ensure that marginalized voices and perspectives are given the space they deserve and that invisible emotional labor is recognized and valued.
