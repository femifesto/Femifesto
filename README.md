# Femifesto

We explore how feminist principles embodies in our Femifesto, a multilingual (Spanish, English, Portuguese, and simplified Chineses) feminist-centered framework for collaborative scholarly communication, can be used to explore scenarios and use cases that arise in a variety of international as well as local scholarly communication contexts. We explore how to enact an ethic of care to ensure that marginalized voices and perspectives are given the space they deserve and that invisible emotional labor is recognized and valued.
